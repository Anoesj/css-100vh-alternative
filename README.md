# CSS `height: 100vh` alternative
A CSS-only alternative for those who've tried getting `height: 100vh` to work properly on mobile phones. It doesn't cover every single case, but it does the job better than `height: 100vh`.

For even better compatibility, see https://github.com/WebReflection/screenfit (sidenote: uses JavaScript)
